# TMUX functions

# This is used to establish a neutral symlink as ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock_for_tmux
# to the current ssh-agent socket. This symlink is the one tmux uses in the
# SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable stored when the tmux server is initialized.
#
# This ensures that all the shells generated by tmux have a reference to a
# static socket path that is not variable by process. (see ~/.tmux.conf for
# where the env variable is set for tmux, and why it gets inherited in each
# session.)
#
# If the ssh session is lost, then when a new session session is started, this
# method should be used again to bless the new SSH_AUTH_SOCK path as the
# ~/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock_for_tmux link so that when reattaching to tmux, ssh
# agent forwarding works again.
